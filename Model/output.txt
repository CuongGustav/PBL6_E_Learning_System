So let US begin A new thremembering On both sides that civility is not a sign of weakness
and sincerity is always subject to proof. Let US never negotiate OUT of fear. But let US
never fear TO negotiate. And if a beachhead of cooperation may push back the jungle
of suspicion let both sides join in creating a new endeavor not A new balance of power
but a new world of law where the strong are just and the weak secure and the speace
preserved.
